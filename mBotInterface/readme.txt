Dear CPS-project team,

in this file you'll find the source code of the mbot interface. 

to run this in your RaspberryPi 3 you'll need to modify the config.txt and the cmdline.txt of your RPi.
Otherwise you can replace it with the files you can find in this folder.
You can find these files in the "/boot" folder of your Raspberry.

this is rquired to switch the ttyAMA0 serial port from the originaly setted onboardBluetooth Chip to the GPIO Pins 
for the serial communication.
